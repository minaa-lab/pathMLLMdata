# Classification

The classification data set is mainly composed of PCam and NCT-CRC-HE-100K. 

PCam consists of 10,000 color images (96 x 96px) extracted from histopathologic scans of lymph node sections. Each image is annoted with a binary label indicating presence of metastatic tissue.

NCT-CRC-HE-100K is a set of 100,000 non-overlapping image patches from hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) stained histological images of human colorectal cancer (CRC) and normal tissue.

10,000 images were selected from each dataset.
